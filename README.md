# kdnsky.exe (Student Project)
kdnsky.exe is an Interactive VR-Sound-Experience based on Unity3D.
This Project was inspired by the Painting "Kleine Welten VI" by Wassily Kandinsky during the
100th anniversary of the BAUHAUS style and was used as an exhibit in a theatre during the 
"BauWhat" BAUHAUS festival.
The Installation is based on the Unity3D game enginge for core development, Wwise Middleware for
audio implementation and MaxMSP for additional audio outputs (communication from Unity to Max via OSC).
